# [Visit VibesVille!](https://vibes-ville.netlify.app/)

VibesVille is a job search tool that provides users with detailed quality of life scores for the city a job is in, along with the job posting. 
This tool is designed for users who want to achieve a better work-life-balance and recognize that the location of a job can be nearly as important as the job itself. To that end, our app provides quality of life data for the city that each job is associated with. We want users to find a job AND city that fits their 'vibe'.
